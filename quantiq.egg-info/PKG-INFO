# QuantIQ 🔍

**QuantIQ** is a unified Python library for building robust, uncertainty-aware deep learning systems. It brings together lightweight, modular tools to help researchers and practitioners gain insight into model reliability and risk through principled uncertainty estimation.

## 📦 What's Inside

Quantiq currently includes two powerful uncertainty quantification tools:

### 1. DropWise 🔁
A plug-and-play PyTorch/HuggingFace wrapper for Monte Carlo Dropout–based uncertainty estimation in Transformers.

- Supports classification, regression, QA, and token tagging
- Computes entropy, confidence, and class-wise variances
- Enables dropout during inference for Bayesian-style sampling

### 2. SmartEnsemble 🧠
A deep ensemble wrapper for PyTorch models with support for adversarial training and dual-mode (epistemic + aleatoric) uncertainty estimation.

- Works with any PyTorch model
- Enables risk scoring and calibration
- Includes built-in visualization and prediction APIs
